# DOTFILES

This is a collection of useful tools and the safe haven for my dotfiles. This (hopefully) gets updated from time to time.

## Essential Tools

- [iTerm3](https://www.iterm2.com/) for MacOS
- [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) shell
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/app/id441258766?mt=12)
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/)

## Geting Started

A good guide to get started with `zsh` is this [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-configure-your-macos-terminal-with-zsh-like-a-pro-c0ab3f3c1156/).

```bash
# Go to base directory
cd

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/lukaschoebel/dotfiles .dotfiles

# Create symbolic link to the .zshrc of the system
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```
